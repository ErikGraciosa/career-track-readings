Arch style/patterns

Have a plan, don't make your own plan, use a common plan like:

Presentation layer or UI layer
Application layer or Service layer
Business logic layer or Domain layer
Data access layer or Persistence layer

or, event-driven, domain driven, pipes and filters, microservices

Container and Presentation

container: stateful, how it works

presentation: how it looks

Container Details


like class component in lecture, use this.setState.

Presentation Details


has html, passing props, use propTypes.

Function vs class components


functional component can't use setState(), but custom hooks changes that.

functional components: smaller, easier to read, maybe faster performance in future versions of React.

Conditional Rendering


Using a component and boolean linked to state to toggle if component renders or not.
