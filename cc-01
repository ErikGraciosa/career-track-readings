Code Challenge 01
Object Basics - How to use short hand with objects that have equal values for key and value.
Objects Computed Properties - Lots of new syntax, examples of key names possible construction. The 'get' notation is new to me.

Classes Creation - 

Object Destructuring-
Arrays- done
Strings- done
Objects- done
Destructuring with Defaults- done
Destructuring function params- feels like more error handling with default params
destructuing with alias- done

Rest
As a param - wow, eliminating args was surprising. avoiding wrong number of args passed.
Rest while destructuring-done

Spread- kinda like opposite of rest, unpacks array into separate values

Function Defaults- how to avoid bad args passed into a function, beginnging of error handling?
