Cool, a walkthrough on webscrapping. Funny the end of the article warns not to get blocked then offers a webscrape API.

These seem like the big takeaways. Also this youtube video was helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzZ3YOUhCxo

✅ NodeJS is a Javascript runtime to allow Javascript to be run in the server-side. It has a non-blocking nature thanks to the Event Loop.
✅ HTTP Clients such as Axios, Superagent, Node fetch and Request are used to send HTTP requests to a server and receive a response.
✅ Cheerio abstracts the best out of JQuery for the sole purpose of running it in the server-side for web crawling but does not execute Javascript code.
✅ JSDOM creates a DOM per the standard Javascript specification out of an HTML string and allows you to perform DOM manipulations on it.
✅ Puppeteer and Nightmare are high-level browser automation libraries, that allow you to programmatically manipulate web applications as if a real person were interacting with it.

basically it seems like import these libraries, use them to query the DOM, hopefully on something easy like a unique id then store that somewhere.
