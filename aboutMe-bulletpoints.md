Not sure what to say in about me? Ask yourself questions before the interviewer, then answer those questions in about me. My notes from about me video.

## Why are you interested in the job?
- For this one I looked at what Atlassian did, saw that they own Jira and Trello and I've used those and was interested in the colloboration and project organizing products. So I point out I've used them and what I think of them.

## Basic Intro, who are you? (Basically saying 'I am ready to talk about these things, you should ask me about them, add whatever other high level topics or detailed topics you want to talk about here to guide the interviewer to ask about them)
- Currently engineering fullstack javascript appilcations using:
  - React
  - Express
  - NodeJS
  - PostgresSQL

# What do you want? What are you here?
### More than I want this job, why do you want this job?
- Interested in joining dev team and focusing on details of technical problems and troubleshooting vs previous work of coordinating resources and setting up logistics and repetitive work.

## Relate it back to an experience.
 - I did ____fill in the blank____, it relates to code ____fill in the blank_____. And that is why I am a good software engineer/dev.

For me this was debugging factory equipment and describing broken stuff that I fixed and then telling a brief story of how to find exactly what is broken and fixing it then or handing off to others to fix. 

## Maybe one strength, I list engineering methodology below and how I used it to fix machines.
1. Define the problem(what are the requirements)
1. Create measureables(how can I problem the problem is solved?)
1. Create solution
1. Measure that the solution meets the problem requirement.
1. Determine next steps, repeat.


## My past experiences
- The biggest guidance for why this composition became is from a job fair experience when I was talking to a Boeing recruiter. Basically I gave my about me at the time and the response from the recruiter was "Nice to meet you, you never mentioned airplanes once, you don't actually want this job." 
- I'm really trying to speak about details of why I want this particular job and overlap my experiences for why I'm good for this particular job.
- I try to use the about me as introduction to topics that I would like to talk about that relate to code and why I'm a good fit.
