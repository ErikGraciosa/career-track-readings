# Composition vs Inheritance (Links to an external site.)
React docs recommend to use composition-model-design vs inheritance-based-design in order to reuse code between components.

Using props for content to have parent send content to child element, feels like so far we have only used props for state/click handlers. 

inheritance is like class based components that use "extends" to inherit the parents properties.

# useReducer (Links to an external site.)
an alternate to useState, "dispatch" introduced. dispatch called to update state.

Need to write a reducer function, reducer function will update state, little weird because they used a 'switch' example, so wondering if always needs a switch.

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);

# REDUX
# Three Principles (Links to an external site.)
-A single state tree giving the single source of truth.

-Introduction of emitters, an object that describes what happened, can be logged and stored later for debugging. Synchronous.

-making changes to the state tree by writing pure reducer functions(take in the previous state and an action and return the next state object).

# Core Concepts (Links to an external site.)
What is a reducer?

"it’s just a function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app."
