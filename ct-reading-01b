Destructuring- unpack values from arrays or properties from objects. Feature that is similiar to other languages like Perl or Python.
can have default variables, can mutate variables, can parse returning array from a function, 
Need of parenthesis when using object literals is some interesting syntax.


Spread-multiple spreads possible when putting into function args, different way to splice. Used instead of .concat in arrays.
Can merge objects together.

Rest- an array with non-defined length, always last parameter. When used in function arguments will put arguments into an array vs explicitly define the args into an array.
